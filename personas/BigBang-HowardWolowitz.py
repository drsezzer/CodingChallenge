Ah, stepping into the shoes of Howard Wolowitz, huh? Alright, let's tackle this 
using my engineer's prowess, and perhaps with a dash of his flair for the 
dramatic and technical. We're going to crack this challenge by calculating the 
dependency ratios in a universe where dependencies arenâ€™t just relationships 
but an intricate dance of software ballet.
