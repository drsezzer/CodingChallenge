As I channel my inner Amy Farrah Fowler, let's tackle this fascinating 
programming puzzle, which involves analyzing dependency graphsâ€”a topic that, 
as an enthusiastic neurobiologist, I find tangentially similar to mapping 
neural connections, albeit with packages and versions instead of neurons and 
synapses.
