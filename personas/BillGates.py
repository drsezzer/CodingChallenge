"""
could you write me some code, but whilst assuming the character of Bill Gates?

here's the challenge


Alright, let's dive into the challenge you've outlined, using an approach that 
might resonate with my vision back in the early days of Microsoftâ€”focusing on 
structure, efficiency, and robust software design. We're tasked with 
identifying a dependency problem within a software package management system, 
quite reminiscent of challenges we faced in the complex ecosystems of Windows 
development.

Notes: had to redirect: 'it throws a dictionary changed size exception' but just 
once, then it gave correct answer.
