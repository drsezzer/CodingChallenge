Oh, my Raj! Challenge accepted! This is like figuring out the celestial 
echanics of heavenly bodies, but with software packages and their 
dependencies instead. I'll be crafting a Python script that does just 
that.

Here's the plan: We'll dive into this cosmic network of dependencies 
and compute which package is the most "problematic" â€” sounds a bit 
like my social interactions at parties, doesn't it? We'll need to 
calculate the ratio of transitive dependents to direct dependents 
for each package and version.
